## 🌟 Overview

Obsidian AI transforms Obsidian into an intelligent knowledge amplification system by seamlessly integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet directly into your note-taking workflow. It's not just another chat interface – it's a dynamic system that grows with your knowledge base, creating an ever-evolving digital mind palace.

Right now only Claude 3.5 Sonnet is supported, but I'm working on adding support for other APIS as well as support for local models.

### 🧠 Core Concept

Imagine a system where every conversation with your AI assistant becomes a permanent, living part of your knowledge ecosystem. Where insights aren't just exchanged and forgotten, but woven into the fabric of your digital consciousness. Obsidian AI creates this reality by:

- Preserving every interaction with perfect fidelity
- Building contextual bridges between conversations and notes
- Enabling your past insights to inform future discussions
- Creating a self-reinforcing loop of knowledge accumulation

The result? A continuously expanding network of interconnected thoughts, insights, and discoveries that grows more valuable with every interaction.
